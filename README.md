# imageThresholding
Noise removal of image using Otsu, Global and Adaptive thresholding technique OpenCV
This is a simple but yet powerful thresholding techniques
Global, Adaptive and Otsu techniques are used on the same image for noise reduction in the image.
Otsu technique is good when the distribution of the image is bimodal.(bimodal image is an image whose histogram has two peaks)
